Minimal virus genome coverage assessment for metagenomic diagnostics

## Overview

Viral metagenomic diagnostics from low-abundance clinical samples can be challenging in the absence of sufficient genome coverage. `Vircov` extracts the number of distinct non-overlapping alignments and generates some helpful statistics. It can be used to automate the flagging of potential hits without manual evaluation of coverage plots.
